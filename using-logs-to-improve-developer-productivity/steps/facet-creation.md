1. Create a facet on the following attributes:

    * `http.url_details.path`
    * `http.method`
    * `http.status_code`

2. Use those facets to filter your log poll.
3. Create an analysis in the [Log analysis page](https://app.datadoghq.com/logs/analytics) that displays the relative share of request count per status code.
