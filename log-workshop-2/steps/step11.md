Now that we can monitor from our frontend to our backend, let's be proactive to reduce our MTTR even more. Go in the Datadog [Synthetics page](https://app.datadoghq.com/synthetics/list) and enable it by selecting *Get started*.

### API test

To periodically check the availability of a public endpoint, [create an API test](https://app.datadoghq.com/synthetics/create).

1. Enter your application URL: https://[[HOST_SUBDOMAIN]]-5000-[[KATACODA_HOST]].environments.katacoda.com/
2. Give you test a name: `Log workshop API test`
2. Click **Test URL**
3. Validate the test by creating **Create test**

This test periodically tries to reach out our application Dashboard from different locations around the world. If it succeeds, it then checks the different assertions defined in the test, and if it fails it sends you a notification.

Scroll down your page and select a test result:

Now select the _Trace_ tab to see the corresponding trace that was generated by your backend for this specific API test. Notice all logs generated by this trace displayed alongside the host metrics collected:
