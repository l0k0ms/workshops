Welcome to Logging with Datadog Log Management workshop.

This Katacoda course contains a "dummy" Water System microservices project - a single page web application with microservices, already instrumented and analyzed using Datadog's APM and infrastructure products.

This workshop gives you setup best practices and a global tour of the Datadog Log Management solution, which shows you how log management can help you to solve issues quickly with your own application.

Today's objectives:

* Collect logs from a pre-existing application.
* Enable Datadog OOTB Processing capabilities.
* Parse Logs to bind them to APM data and make it easier to analyze them.
* Create monitors upon your Log Data.
