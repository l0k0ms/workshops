To add an attribute as a Facet and start using it in your log analytics, click on it:

![create facet](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/l0k0ms/workshops/master/log-workshop-2/images/create_facet.png)

Don't forget to assign a group to your facet to avoid polluting your Log explorer view:

![create facet group](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/l0k0ms/workshops/master/log-workshop-2/images/creating_facet_group.png)

**Note**: Attributes value are indexed AFTER a facet is created:

![facet_not_indexed](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/l0k0ms/workshops/master/log-workshop-2/images/facet_not_indexed.png)

Use your new facet to filter your log explorer view:

![facet_filter_search](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/l0k0ms/workshops/master/log-workshop-2/images/facet_filter_search.png)


Or in your Log analytics:
