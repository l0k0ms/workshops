Let's now discover how you could go beyond log collection with a real app example. Start the Storedog application with the following command:

`app_start`{{execute}}

After a couple of minutes, click on the `storedog` tab of the terminal to see the application running or access this link:

    https://[[HOST_SUBDOMAIN]]-3000-[[KATACODA_HOST]].environments.katacoda.com/

Refresh the Application page, click around to begin generating metrics, APM traces, and logs for your application.
