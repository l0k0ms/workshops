Your logs are key to enhancing APM traces, providing metrics, detecting potential security threats, and maintaining regulatory compliance. Getting the full value from your logs requires more than just collecting and analyzing log lines.

This activity is split in two main parts:

* Part two: We will use a real application fully instrumented to demonstrate how logs can bring context to your metrics and traces.
