After the break we are going to discover how you could go beyond log collection with a real app example.

Start the Storedog application with the following command: `app_start`{{execute}}

After a couple of minutes, click on the `storedog` tab of the terminal to see the application running or access this link:

    https://[[HOST_SUBDOMAIN]]-3000-[[KATACODA_HOST]].environments.katacoda.com/

You should see this page:

![app_homepage](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/l0k0ms/workshops/master/log-workshop-4/images/app_homepage.png)

Refresh the Application page, click around to begin generating metrics, APM traces, and logs for your application.

Alternatively you can click on `generating_traffic`{{execute}} to generate traffic constently.
