While the application is installing, [connect to your Datadog application](https://app.datadoghq.com). You should see a new account available just for the workshop.

The Datadog API key is already setup in your environment, but normally you would get it in the [Integration -> API page](https://app.datadoghq.com/account/settings#api)

Click on the `storedog` tab of the terminal to see the application running or access this link:

    https://[[HOST_SUBDOMAIN]]-3000-[[KATACODA_HOST]].environments.katacoda.com/

Refresh the Application page, click around to begin generating metrics, APM traces, and logs for your application.
