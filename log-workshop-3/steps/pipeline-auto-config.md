All logs are centralized in the [Datadog log explorer](https://app.datadoghq.com/logs):

In this view you can search your logs, detect log patterns, build analytics upon your logs.

If you go to the [log configuration page](https://app.datadoghq.com/logs/pipelines), you can see that some pipelines are already setup thanks to the `source` attribute.
