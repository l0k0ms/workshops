![dd_logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/l0k0ms/workshops/master/log-workshop-3/images/dd_logo.png)

Your logs are key to enhancing APM traces, providing metrics, detecting potential security threats, and maintaining regulatory compliance. Getting the full value from your logs requires more than just collecting and analyzing log lines. This activity will get up and running with logging in a real world application, to see the value logs can bring.

Today's objective is to go beyond, the following topics will be covered:

1. *Beyond collection*: Wait a minuteâ€¦ how does it works ?
2. *Beyond collection*: Standardisation & Normalisation
3. *Beyond collection*: Enrich you logs thanks to categorization and look-up processors.
4. *Beyond collection*: Correlation, Visualisation and Monitoring
5. *Beyond collection*: Management (as in Log Management)

The environment you will work with in this activity is a fictional ecommerce app, Storedog, deployed using Docker. The app is built using a Rails framework along with Python Flask microservices for handling coupon codes and ad services:
